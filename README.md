bennug-ide
==========

Simple BennuGD plugin for IntelliJ

STATUS
------

PRE-ALPHA. This is the result of one white night! 
Do not use in production unless you know that you did a backup.
 
 I will make it available in the Jetbrains repo when stable enough.
 
FORKING
------
You are free to fork and send me pull requests.

FEATURES
--------

- Code coloring (By kind of "variable" : process, function, type, struct)
- Code completion (Only Local variables for now)

MOTIVES
------

Fbmx is good but is becoming old. Bennugd has integrated new features (like "switch")
and they are not available in Fbmx.
Also, IntelliJ is **very** powerful and quite a standard IDE.
